                John “TotalBiscuit” Bain was a commentator, gamer, critic, and beloved icon to many during his life. Throughout his career, he helped shape the
                channels of many other creators: Jesse Cox, Dodger, Quill18, Cohn Carnage, Itmejp, Strippin, and many, many others. His reach was far and
                wide, and even those who disagreed with his criticisms of the industry or other divisive topics still regarded John as an incredible individual.

                    Sadly, John Bain passed away on the 24th of May due to his stage 4 colon cancer. This cancer was something he struggled
                    with for years, and yet he still found time to provide for his fans, friends, and especially his family. Personally,
                    I found great inspiration in dealing with my own bone cancer by looking up to this amazing human being. Thank you for
                    taking the time to read this extremely small excerpt and tribute to his life.
